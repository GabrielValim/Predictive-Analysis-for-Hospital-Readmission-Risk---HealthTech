# 🩺 Prediction of Hospital Readmissions in Diabetic Patients

> Machine learning project focused on predicting hospital readmissions in diabetic patients, using public clinical data and classification techniques to support healthcare decisions.

## 📌 About the project
This project applies data science techniques to predict which patients are at higher risk of being readmitted within 30 days after hospital discharge. The analysis is based on a real healthcare dataset, focusing on the diabetic population.

## 🧠 Technologies used
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 📊 Steps developed
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Preprocessing and variable treatment
- Attribute engineering
- Modeling with classification algorithms
- Evaluation with metrics such as F1-score and AUC-ROC
- Visualizations for interpreting results
